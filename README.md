# Weather App

A simple weather app built with React, TypeScript, Redux, and the OpenWeather API. This app allows users to search for current weather data and a 7-day forecast for a given city.

**Note**: This project was created to practice TypeScript and strengthen my skills with TypeScript in a React-based application.

## Features

- Search for weather by city name or coordinates (latitude/longitude).
- Displays current weather information including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Shows a 7-day extended weather forecast.
- Converts temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience.
- **Redux**: State management for handling asynchronous data fetching.
- **OpenWeather API**: External API for fetching weather data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
